# Getting Started

`rustfmt` - for formatting code according to the opinionated standard of the community (not a bad thing tbh)


Sample Program
```
fn main(){
    println!("Hello World")
}
```

the main function is the entry point - like C
println! -> the bang operator is used for rust macros.

how do you run this? like C. compile and execute the binary.
`rustc ~ gcc`

that is like the very basics.

## Cargo

cargo is the build system and package manager of rust. it makes it easier to manage **dependencies**(other pieces of code).
something like npm?
